# GodotProceduralTerrain

In this Godot 4++ project, the utilization of the newly integrated FastNoiseLite API facilitates the dynamic generation of terrain through the experimentation of diverse noise generation methods employing various equations. 

The codebase serves as a testing ground for evaluating noise generation functions, providing a framework to choose a noise function and port the code seamlessly into C# or C++ to optimize the performance via threading or other means.


Thank you for downloading and taking time to look at the project, it's appreciated.
