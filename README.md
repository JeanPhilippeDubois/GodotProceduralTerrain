# GodotProceduralTerrain

In this Godot 4++ project, we harness the power of the recently integrated FastNoiseLite API to dynamically generate terrain through the exploration of diverse noise generation methods, incorporating equations such as Perlin and Simplex.

The project provides a flexible framework for choosing a noise function and seamlessly porting the code into C# or C++ for performance optimization, leveraging threading and other means.

Furthermore, the generation of clouds is done through a noise map image, resulting in the creation of realistic volumetric clouds that move dynamically in real-time.

Your interest is greatly appreciated, and we thank you for taking the time to explore this project.

Feel free to download, make changes, and contribute by submitting pull requests. 

Your collaboration is invaluable!
