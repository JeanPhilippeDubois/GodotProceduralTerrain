# GodotProceduralTerrain

In this Godot 4++ project, we use the integrated FastNoiseLite API to dynamically generate a 3D terrain through diverse noise generation methods, such as Perlin and Simplex. 

The project provides a flexible framework for choosing a noise function and porting the code into C# or C++ for performance optimization, if you leverage threading and other means.

Furthermore, the generation of clouds is done through a noise map image, resulting in the creation of realistic volumetric clouds that move dynamically in real-time.

It is a great project to understand how you would create a 3D scene in Godot using modern methods. 

Your interest is greatly appreciated, and we thank you for taking the time to explore this project.

Feel free to download, make changes, and contribute by submitting pull requests. 

Your collaboration is invaluable!
